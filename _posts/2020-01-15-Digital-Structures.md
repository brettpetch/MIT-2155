## Assignment 1
- Due Jan 29, start of class
- 750-1000 words, not counting references.
- Evaluate your online "footprint", assessing what is public/private, and what it says about your oneline/offline identity
- link to relevant concepts in Fuchs; also Baym
- No research needed beyond course readins and websites; but still cite according to Chicago Author-Date style
- Focus on technical aspects (diction, grammar, etc.)

When Fuchs talks about the types of different types of being online, we will tie in different kinds of identity, etc.

## Group Presentations
- 20 minute presentation by group members on a case study related ot the themes of this course
- 10 minute class discussion moderated by group members
- Groups must go over their topic with me at least two weeks before the presentation
- Presentation dates first-come, first-served
- topics do not have to align with the subject matter for the week you present.
- Avail. Timeslots begin Feb 5th, (one week before midterm).

## Explaining Social Behaviour
- Building on Durkheim, Weberr, etc., mid-20th century sociologists attempt to discover what "social facts" and "social actions" look like in daily life.
- Psychologists also interested in these phenomena post-WWII (cf. Stanley Milgram's 1960s obedience, looking up experiments).
- These findings later applied to online group dynamics.
- These types of interactions are replicated in different ways online, which is why some of these psychologists still have currency.

### Harold Garfnkel
- American Sociologist and Ethnomethodologist
- 1917-2011
- His experiment: breaching experiments as teaching tools - 

#### Ethnomethodology
- The way you go about your everyday buisness
> people make joint sense of their social world *together* and [how] they do methodologically using social procedures or methods that they share
>> John Heritage, *Key socioogical Thinkers*, p. 176
- what Garfinkel and colleagues were looking at: what happens when we go against the normal behaviours
- Realizes that social situations governed by "background expectancies" (social norms or rules)
- difficult to explicitly describe these rules.
- breaching experiments can help us uncover these rules and the tacit or 'background knowledge' underpinning social interactions.

#### Daily Social Norms
- We are expected to act certain ways, use certain technologies without being told
- Eg. interacting with strangers in washroms, elevtors, public transit.
- New tech often challenge norms because we don't have a set of expectations worked out yet (examples?)
- Social Nroms: Candid Camera, 1962
    - will someone being experimented on conform to 'this new thing'

### Norm Breaching Experiments
- Garfinkel assigned studetns to act like boarders in their own homes, take notes of what went on.
- Reactions usually confused, hostile.
- Other experiments included having subjects interview fake job applicants with contradictory credentials (gaslighting)

### Contemporary Breaching Experiments in Social Media
- Oversharing: Picking someone you don't know well and for 24 hours dramaticlaly increase the information you send this person throuhg direct messaging (eg. mobile texting or SC).
- Picture creeper: going through soemone's photos on social media and commenting on 15+ photos that are at least 6 months old.
