## Ideology
It's quite useful in how te talk about how a medium can have an ideology. This is something that Fuchs can get into. He talks about ideology without setting it up as much as I'd like. Althusser says "A representation of the imaginary relationship of individuals to their real conditions of existence" (Louis Althusser)

## Google
PhD Students Sergey brin & Larry Page develop search engine
search based on secret pagerank algorithm, web relevance.

### Ideology of Google
Fuchs critiques. When they started out, Google has the early company motto of
> Don't be evil

This has slowly hidden away. Google itself turned into one of these massive corporations and created its own burocracy. Tried to get investors to buy into this "new kind of company". Another ideological function is that ads are fine as long as they're relevant. Better to have ads that know what you want already. If you opt out, they're no longer tied to your search history.

Tax avoidance is fine since it's legal.
