## Henry Jenkins
This is a good intervention over time, where up until the 1980-1990's critical media studies was not considered to be academic. Before a couple decades back, communication was regarded as being only one directional. What Jenkins did at this time was to think of pop culture texts as participatory. How would this relate back into gemeinschaft  (Community), gesellschaft (society). The Community is more based on a shared feelng of values of norms, not just a sense of unity, but also interdependance. In the community, they have shared norms, but society doesn't necessarily have culture, but rather interdependance. Can we match this into fan cultures? If we think of this as an organic community and artificial society, Jenkins is trying to say that despite culture being fabricated by industrial entities you can still have fanbases, make new texts, etc. Jenkins started this with Textual Poachers in 1992, pre-modern internet. He looked at TV and recording episodes, remixing and changing meaning of texts. Textual poachers: Spawk holding Darth Vader. This is staging a scene from 1940's. It requires a cultural competence. See reading, IE *Convergence Culture* (2006), *Spreadable Media* (2013). One of the things that he argued is that it is alot easier to download files / record tv than it used to. We can also look at this throuhg Video Game modding, Open Source Software, etc. 
- American media scholar
- 1958-
- Joint appointmentsat USC, formerly at MIT Comparative Media program
- Focus on texts of popular culture as sites of creation/community, not just consumption.
### Participatory Culture
- Low barriers to artistic expression / civil engagement
- Strong support for creating and sharing (community aspect, people that will openly help educate the fandom)
- Mentorship, typically infomral, 
- there is this sense of what they are doig matters
- Members see as huge community aspect.

That all sounds great... until Fuchs comes out and criticises this.
#### Fuchs: Celebratory Cultural Studies Sucks!
This turn away from went too far starting in the 1990's. It might be a good thing. Thought that it was just a way for people to celebrate their popular culture. In the 1990's there was a corperate assimilation, where things were spread. Turned into: Disney owns everything. This affects what texts actually get made. Does Fuchs have an axe to grind? While all of these things are possible, people may choose to continue on without turning their attention to it.
- Academic turn (1990's) toward objects of popular pleasure derided by old guard as "celebratory"
- Too much attention on the nature of audiences, subjectivity? Not enough of the structures / political economy behind pop culture.
- Does Fuchs have an axe to grind?

#### Bronies
This was a reboot, but this reincarnation of the franchise captured the attention of what is now known as the Bronies or Pegasisters on 4chan. A BBC News Report on Bronies (2014). You may like to know why this is covered in the news. How is this shown in the media? Shown as friends in a community, people will be trashed for being fans of the show. They portray this as a magical community where people make friends, etc. Throwaway line "people call me gay"... glossed over. Many of these fandoms have dark underworlds. More Background that ties into this continued below...
*My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic* 2010 - 

#### Slash Fiction
While it's perfectly fine for men to watch girly tv shows, one of the very influential genres is "Slash Fiction"... Has anyone come across this before? (NO). This starts in the 1960-1970's. The fanbase would write erotica about *Star Trek*'s Kirk and Spock, labeled as K/S or slash sotires. Slash is simply one of the important forms of fan writing. Slash constitutes a large genre inside of fan culture. 
- Female fans write erotica about *Star Trek*'s Kirk and Spock, labeled as "K/S" or "slash" stories (c. 1970s)
- Slash a common sub-genre of fan fiction for many franchises; often heteronomative audiences.
- Femslash from 1990s onward (eg. Xena, Glee; showrunners were more accessible via Twitter, etc.)

#### Bronies: Critique of Fan Politics
While fandom is not passive, it does create discourse, new texts, etc. But is it political? The issues are in the fictions being written to connect themselves.
- Fandom not passie; creates discourse, new texts, etc.
- But following Fuchs, is MLP / Brony culture poltical?
- Challenge ot gender norms; but how much of this goes on in daily practice of fans, esp. vs. Slash / Femslash.

#### Bronies: Critique of Fan Politics
- Who does fandom belong to? What members define it? (Fuchs: "White Boys with participatory toys")
- Sexism, racism, harassment ironically present in fandoms like Bronies as well
- Is hate "spreadable" too?

#### Fandom: The Dark Side
Star Wars: new movies felt like an itemized list where they needed to fulfil a PC Social Justice Warrier to pander to the audience. What are the implications of this arguement? If your audience is 15 year old white boys, then why aren't you pandering to that? The Phantom Edit was one of the early remixes, someone cut out everything they didn't like. They cut out all the female characters... 
- Participatory culture/fandom not inherently progressive; can be neutral or distructive
- Vicious blowback against minority representation in new *Star Wars*, *Star Trek*
- cf. new *Ghostbusters*, *Ocean's 11*
- Remixes/mashups can be benign like *Phantom Edit* or hostile like *Last Jedi* "Chauvinist Cut"

#### Poe's Law
Essentially, Nathan Poe coined the term. (-2) It becomes difficult to figure out if people are being sarcastic or not. People will often talk about their position, haha funny. 
- Social media exacebate these problems because sincerity / anonymity are more felxible (cf. Baym)
- Poe's Law: on social media, sincere expressions of extremeism often indistinguishable from saterical expressions of extremism.

## Online Fascism: Participatory Culture?
While we may not necessarily participating in this kind of content, we may look at the differce between a saterical content reaction ("attacking the sacred cows of our culture"[political correctness]). 
- Lulz culture: 4chan and Reddit as sites where ironic / non-ironic memes spread
- Rejection of "political correctness" feeds into right-wing reactionism
- Fuchs: soccer hooliganism also rise of the "alt-right"
