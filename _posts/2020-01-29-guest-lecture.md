# What do Social Media Companies Make?
While traditional companies make a [something], they are untraditional and don't PRODUCE any content. Today, we'll be looking at what they make, how they make money, and how we can analyze this. For Fuchs, political economy a corrective to insufficient "celebratory" analyses. Obviously, if you've done the reading, you'll know that this critiques some of the more celebratory 

# Political Economy
Understanding political and economic power structures to understanding media. You don't have to be a marxist. Specifically, concepts of capital accumulation and surplus value (profit) are key. The concept I want you to understand is surplus profit and cap. accumulation...

## Social Capital
Knowing people, etc.

## Economic Capital
Under capitalism, this is one of the most important things.
In how capital accumulation works is Money becomes more money. The idea is that if you have money and want to make more money, you can buy commodity, modify or resell it, then make more money.

We've established how we get surplus value. The money from the sold commodity is subtracted from the money in it to calculate surplus value.

People like Fuchs take the standard working day under capitalism where you're working 9-5 by necessary labour time and surplus labour time. Necessary labour time is the amount of time to maintain their labour power. Surplus labour time is the things you have to do to get into the next day. A point at which you are working under capitalism where you're doing more work than you need to to sustain yourself.

Surplus labour time, under the capitalist system it's unpaid labour time. "I work for 8 hours and I get paid for 8 hours" you're not being paid for how much you generate, but rather for how much you generate.

You may not feel exploited, but under this capitalism, you're still generating value without compensation. 

To increase surplus value, it can be broken to absolute surplus value and relative surplus value. 

Absolute surplus value is generating more work. You can length the amount of time worked, etc. you can work more days, 7 instead of 5. It's just MORE. It's not about types of work.

Relative surplus value is about increasing the productivity and efficiency, generating more in the same amount of time.

The big takeaway:
Do not mistake value for price, the price we put on something is a stock in itself. The way Marx justifies talking about value coming from work is that it is stuff people do in cooperation or collaboration. 

## Dallas Smyth (1907-1992)
Was a political economist of media. He argued that broadcasting companies generate audiences to sell to advertisers.

Goes against the Folk definition of the deal of watching TV; when free to air instead of cable... In exchange for free entertainment, you had to sit through ads.

## Social media audiences and surplus value
The free lunch of entertainment turns into access to social networks. In return for socialization (the draw), ads.

Ability to work to build audiences for ads and ourselves.

## Online ad pricing models
CPM = Cost per mille (1000 impressions)
CPC = Cost per Click
CPE = Cost per Engagement
CPV = Cost per View
CPA = Cost per Action / Acquisition

## Increasing surplus value of audience labour
Absolute SV: Increase size of audience
Relative SV: Increase efficiency of ads, which you can use targeted ads or cover a broader audience.
For the former, explains need to grow userbase/netowrks, have more followers etc.
For the latter, explains targeting, data mining, ad rate auctions / placement.
data mining makes advertising more efficient. 

## Relative SV: Sorting and surveillance
In old mass media days, market research is expensive and inefficient. The nielsen list vs. Netflix. Now we do the work of surveyors and classify / sort ourselves. Passively through increased monitoring of activity, and actively through labelling profiles, joining groups, etc.

# Segue: The Video Game Industry,
This textbook doesn't talk a whole lot about how the modern video game industry is caught up in these same ideas of exploitation. In rare earth metals, etc. some of the latest techniques of making people work 20 hours a day for weeks on end, pooling capitalism through increased consolidation if intellectual property, etc.

## The Video Game Industry
The global video game market revenue is about 152 billion dollars USD (revenue). The gaming industry is setup in the way a publisher is a company that finances the making of games and is responsible for the marketing and distributing them. Often a developer will pitch a game to get an advance to start making a game, then publishers will take revenue from sales. Additionally, the publishers will sell soundtracks, etc.

The video game industry is split between Triple-A games, with budgets in excess of feature films, budgets <200 Million is somewhat comment.

Increasing levels of vertical integration, globalization.

### Canada in Video Games
Canada is the 3rd largest game industry in the world with almost 700 studios. IT is mostly small studios. Canada's gaming industry generates ~4-5 bilion dollars / year. 55% of studios in canada have fewer than 5 employees. 4% of companies employ 2/3 of the game industry workers in the country. It is supported by provincial subsidies. There is some growth at the moment in the atlantic. Ubi in MTL.

### So where does the exploitation come from?
#### Manufacturing: 
Game consoles and other hardware built by same suppliers as social media tech. Workers in conflict zones as well as factories have their surplus labour value taken.

#### Crunch Time Game Development
Firm deadlines, tech complexity, make surplus value hard to get form game development.
Crunch - last weeks/months of game development involves extremely long hours for workers
No overtime for crunch, despite non-professional nature of the work; this has led to lawsuits, union push.

### Mobile and Causal Gaming
Mobile games have been growing fast. In 2019, $70 Billion revenue. People are buying smaller games that they can play in spurts through their day. Often, they're casual games with simple rules. This means low commitment. The causal market is superficially social, but community building is mostly instrumental.

### Free to Play: Ads in Games
Casual games are often supported by the "free to play" model; where downloads are free, but watching ads and in-game purchases gives advantages. Predatory games are pay to win, where players need to pay to unlock functionality when competing with others. Often there is an element of gambling (loot boxes, etc.)
