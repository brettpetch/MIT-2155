# Today
- Pop Quiz
- Midterm feedback
- Facebook and Twitter: PRivacy and Publicity
- Surveillance: Political, Corperate, Educational
- Advertising distorting the public sphere: bot,s analytic bubbles and fake news

I will also remind you that the content will be fair game for the final exam. That is a possible thing to be tested on.

The class average was at ~70% with a spread from 51-82. No one failed. Generally speaking, there were a few problems with multiple choice. Couldn't figure out where the problem wa.s I think it was just unfamiliarity with general course material. People who did come to class did better than those who did not. Most of the issues in the essay were not using the concepts / course materials. If you were doing a question about a reading, you should have been doing things in context. The point of doing a midterm / final is that you did come to class and did the reading. Ensure you do the such and such of the so and so. The marks are porportionate to the section. The numbers squiggled on teh side are 20, 15, 15, 50. This doesn't mean you had to say 15 things for 1 term, it was 4-5 tops. If something doesn't add up, let me know and i'll try to brush up on my math.

Any queestions about the midterm?
- Final: Bring in a dictionary? Lower expectations for final exam. 
- Is the final cumulative? Somewhat, it will be 3 essay questions or 2 essay questions and a bunch of multiple choice. Multiple choice + 2 essays, or 3 essays. There will be a cumulative element, however it will be based on the 2nd half of the course. If you want, come to office hours if you'd like to go over everything.

## Facebook
One of the interesting trends I saw was that alot of you signed up on Facebook then left the platform. It's something interesting to see what the early adoption. 

### Small history: 
Started by Harvard undergrads in 2004. It was being bankrolled by venture capitalists, expanded to other universities. The idea that it was a scrappy startup was really being founded by a PayPal founder, and the idea is misleading. When Facebook started up, it was originally exclusive to university students, then General Public access was opened in 2006. The business model became advertising platform.

### Michel Foucault (1926-1984)
Concerned with power relations, typically associated with Barthes, Maccon. Studies power, biopolitics, etc. Today, we're interested in *Discipline and Punish*. Anyone know why it's translated as discipline? any guess? The idea of surveillance is a discipline? possibly that it tries to change the human condition? 
- French philosopher and literary critic
- concerned with postmodern unsderstanding of power relations in society.
- Discipline and punish uses idea of panopticon to explain state surveillance as control method in prisons, schools, etc.

#### Surveillance and Privacy
Foucault is interested in surveillance and power, Fuchs looks at a "negative" theory of surveillance. Fuchs identifies different notions of privacy
- Restricted Access Theory: Only information that you give out.

#### Political Surveillance: Edward Snowden
Edward Snowden was a CIA / NSA contractor who leaked the details of mass surveillance programs against US citizens. He fled Hawaii to Russia via Hong Kong; USA continues to demand his prosecution. State survillance also corporate, as data subcontractors very profitable (Fuchs).

#### Polticial Surveillance: Cambridge analytica
British firm Cambridge Analytica revealed to skim 87 million Facebook users' information without consent and sold the data to political campaigns. Facebook stock dropped after 2018. Zuckerberg testified before congress, promised reform, scandals continue. Generally speaking, nothing has improved to the point where the problem has become solved. There are also more direct ways that Social Media Networks can surveil the state. If you travel internationally, doing research on poltically sensitive topics, etc. Additionally, poltiical surveillance of online data goes beyond big data, eg: checking phones, etc.

#### Economic / Consumer Surveillance
Predictive analytics, which is essentially aggregating consumer spending patterns in order to predict habits and purchasing patterns. Stores predict personal info based on shopping history. Subject of high-profile data breaches, snitching apps on FB, etc. Eg. Amazon predictive shipping, etc. Facebook and other SMS must monitor for illegal / explicit material. This work is typically subcontracted to firms that pay far less than Facebook. Moderators micromanage, suffer from PTSD, have destructive coping behaviour.

#### Educational Surveillance: OWL & Turnitin
Lines between types of surveilance further blurred in education. OWL provides surveillance tools for instructors. Turnitin combs database of student essays. Your coursework commodified and tuition increased for private profits.

# Twitter
Started by Jack Dorsey and others at podcasting company Odeo in 2006. Twitter became quite popular, with 100 thousand users world wide. Fuchs said they never turned a profit, however they have been making money since 2017. Also, (speculation) most notorious tweeters became president of US. There have been a number of buyouts, Tribe with Twitter, instability of advertising model (Fuchs), online harassment, user fraud, etc. 

## Jurgen Habermas (1929 - )
One of the last survivors of the Frankfurt School. His paper about the public sphere and how it's caught up with issues surrounding communications and public policy around the year. Habermas contrasts public sphere with historical, "bourgeois" public sphere. Bourgeois public sphere arises with spread of capitalism in 18th c. Europe. Habermas looks at what we consider what is good in terms of politics: Freedom of speech, association, opinion are primarily based in the capitalist notions of privacy. 

### Fuchs Public Sphere
Criteria for evaluating public sphere: political economic and political-communicative aspects. Political economy: ownership, censorship, exclusion, poltical content production. Polticial communication: universal access, independence, quality of political discussion. People who own news media get to decide what goes into or comes out of it. We can see if everything is concentrated, eg fox: not allow people to publish things on platform, etc. (textbook 223)

## Twitter in the Public Sphere
How these things work out in something like Twitter: We can generalize that twitter is not of the general polity of society as a whole. Becomes something you can monetize through these platforms, you have influencers that are able to shadow market. These consequences, long standing problem: fake audiences, bots, etc. companies that can sell reputations, followers, In the NYT, there was a report about Devumi that would sell accounts to public figures to grow their follower accounts. Many bots were identities that were stolen: these would be sold to other third parties. AFAIK: it's an ongoing problem with Twitter because they don't have the motivation to crack down (userbase is smaller that it may seem). 

### Social Media's Distortion of Democracy
The news feeds customize content ot us based on what we already have seen (analytic bubbles). IT leads to phenomenon of "group polarization", algorithms are now biased based on private bubbles, creating bubbles. Even if you're getting 2nd hand news.

## Twitter and Fake News
The whole fake news thing: Trump himself was one of the people essential to the concept. If you look at the search history, in 2016 it rose sharply. See below:

Some of this is deliberate propaganda, some good ol' american hucksterism (click for $). Studies show people not good at differentiaing, companies slow to regulate, if at all.

### Twitter and Trump:
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Earlier today <a href="https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@realdonaldtrump</a>â€™s account was inadvertently deactivated due to human error by a Twitter employee. The account was down for 11 minutes, and has since been restored. We are continuing to investigate and are taking steps to prevent this from happening again.</p>&mdash; TwitterGov (@TwitterGov) <a href="https://twitter.com/TwitterGov/status/926238960594178048?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 3, 2017</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script> 
Problems of Social Media and politics metastasize with Donald Trump, who uses personal account for official statements. Donald Trump has kept his Twitter the same since becoming the president. It makes it hard to figure out public statement / policy. There's things that say you can't delete presidential documents.

# Social Response to Fake News
There have been concerns that Twitter has not been cracking down on hatespeech. Twitter said that hatespeech is not going to be redacted by an algorithm because it aligns with republican candidates. Facebook announces new fact-checking measures for what users share, but won't do so for paid political ads.

A month or two ago, Facebook did rollout a number of new factchecking measures which should help. If the political candidate was to run a 30 second ad, they would not filter it. It's protected political speech. If you as a private citizen was wanting to share that, you'd have to jump through some hoops.

# Conclusion
This is the end of today, we have discussed Facebook and Twitter and the raise concerns about what social media means for privacy and publicity. We have also discusses Facebook's surveillance entwined with other political-economic forms of data gathering. Next week: Group Presentations. Please show up a bit earlier, check tech beforehand. Presenter mode does not work in any of these classrooms. You may read them off your laptop, but not the monitor. I think that's it. I will hand back your midterms, they are alphabetized by last name.
