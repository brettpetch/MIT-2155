# Intro
We will be talking about video games being used for propagandic purposes, we'll be doing our next pop-quiz.

Today, we will talk about the Bogost reading, using videogames as systematic critiques of ideology. This is part of the broader trend of the sub-category of a serious game (motive is beyond that of just a fun video game). One of the big problems with games is that they don't always work. In the 2nd half, we'll talk about Gabriela Coleman and Anonymous. They raise a number of issues when using internet as a ground for online activism. DDoS or other forms of hacktivism. Then we have Group 3 and Group 1 presenting. Any questions? Comments?

We'll likely have at least one more opportunity to do a pop quiz.

# Bogost
Let's talk about Bogost:

He is a game designer at Georgia Tech, and was prolific in writing a number of books / procedural issues within video games, when a lot of scholars were coming from film and reading videogames the same way a novel or a film would be read. He realized that the algorithmic component was more important to study. He's also associated with 'gamification', wherein he said 'it's not about making good games' but rather convincing marketers that this is the new fad. If you've heard of Jane McGonical, another scholar of gamification. She argues for making games out of doing chores with roommates. Encouraging people to take out trash, cleaning up, etc. He also has his own Game Development Studio, some of the games were commissioned by consumer products companies, marketers, etc. Eg: escape your cubicle to get into a VW Beatle. That's to give a little context: the examples are from *Pursuasive Games* (2007).

### So what is he talking about in Persuasive Games and Procedural Rhetoric?
A procedure is a defining characteristic of digital media and is the execution of a series of rules. If we think of video games at a computational level, there is a quantifiable and predictable aspect to it. In Rhetoric, this is the effective and pursuasive expression. The combination here is taking this idea of trying to appeal through emotion and using it in a new medium through video games. Procedural Rhetoric: The practice of using processes persuasively. It's about showing people how processes work and convincing them to do something along those lines; puts forth some kind of ideology.

## Ideology and Algorithmic Culture
You'll remember a few weeks ago when we talked about ideology and the marxist thinkers.
>Ideology "practices and modes of thouhgt that present aspects of human existance ... that are historical and changable as eternal and unchangeable" 
- (Fuchs p.18)

Just a refresher as well,
> "A 'representation' of the imaginary relationship of individuals to their real conditions of existence"
- (Althusser)

### Case Study: Tomb Raider Franchise
Western adventurer hero that seeks out things to put artifacts in museum. Something that underpins alot of this... Civilization is very similar, where you colonize North America -- some of the ideological underpinnings: 

### Other sort of classic examples are like The Sims, etc.
Ideology and Algorithmic Culture:
- Media like video games can be ideological when they represent ideas, groups, etc. (sexism, racism)
- However, they can also be ideological in what processes they use and how they model them.
- According to some critics, ours is interestingly an 'algorithmic culture', where we are defined less by discrete kinds of things and rather...

## Serious Games
- Term coined in 1970 in Clark Abt's book of that name. In the 50's and 60's, there were many attempts to use boardgames, etc. to try to get students to learn. This was later picked up by video game developers, critics, etc. this hasn't been particularly successful. Like plunking children in front of a television, the teacher will have to ask the students about processes, etc. Covers a large swathe of games that are not purely about entertainment, even if they might have begun that way. 

### Case: America's Army (2002-2015)
In the 90's, the US Army invested in video game technology for recruiting and training purposes, etc. He was able to get the army to invest in developing a number of games. There have been ~3-4 major versions of the game, and was basically the most successful dollar for dollar marketing ploy. Absorbed 1/3 of marketing budget, ~40% have played game before joining military. University of California has the Institute for Creative Technologies funded by army, collaberated between military, games industry, and universities. ICT brings social scientists, computer scientists, etc. Using VR to treat PTSD, etc. 

### Poltical Games and Newsgames
Some serious games that have overt political messages and/or based on current events. Example: September 12 ('03); Voter Suppression Trail ('16), Easy Level Life ('16), Thunderbird Strike ('17), Super Bernie World ('20).

### Parody and Satire
These an have problems with messaging efficacy or timeliness. Steam game "I Can't believe it's not Gambling". Other more complex parodies, "To Build a Better Mousetrap", which I may be able to get running for you; more systemic of production and labour. 

# Gabriella Coleman
To get onto our second reading, Gabriella Coleman was able to study / interview members of Anonymous for many years on IRC. While she was working on her 1st book and getting a job, she was able to gain the trust of many of the people / etc. reported on some of that Anonymous was doing. A bit of background on Anonymous, they were active before this on 4chan imageboard. Focused on pranks, 'lulz'; often apolitical or even deliberately offensive. There were alot of people interested in the use and abuse of computer systems to push a poltical agenda. This would be civil disobediance, etc. took old fashioned techniques and ported them to the digital realm. Was about being harmless, and other times offensive. In the teen virtual world, they made swastikas out of black people.

## Anonymous 
Became more political (c. 2008) with 'project chanology' v. Church of Scientology. They decided to protest outside in LA, used the first fox mask...  This starts to pick up, as you recall the crash of 2008, political upheaval, new demonstrations of all sorts of things going on at this point. This is the point when they started finding poltical and corporate targets; DDoS attacks on PayPal, Via, Mastercard, Sony, and government websites ("AvengeAssange"). Were able to release government documents... Lots of blowback from government. They became more progressive in the 20teens, supporting occupy wall street, attacking fox news, etc. and they rickrolled ISIS after the 2015 paris attacks.

### Symbolism
Anonymous first donned Guy Fawkes maks in Project Chanology. This has also been related, crack ford resign, the show homeland. The masks became signifiers of protests in general, but also advocates anarchy, privacy, etc. For instance, one hacker based in France that goes by the handle from Mr. Robot (ElliotAlderson). Hacker make a Yelp Clone to predict how friendly a resteraunt was to Trump Supporters.

### Issues
The activities of groups like Anonymous are not only cut and dried, and there is no nature to how ethical the groups are. The fluid nature of the group makes it problematic, little accountability, no long term goals. Additionally, there are ethical problems: DDoS -- how would it impact free speech. 

- DDoS is a Distributed Denial of Service; flood server with activity to force it into submission. If you wanted to deny service to [uwo.ca](https://www.uwo.ca), what if someone needs to access the system to submit their paper in time, or... You may have issues with the corporation that is behind the technology, but you may still need to pay bills, get paychecks, etc. Doxxing is the public release of private documents, police knowing something and not releasing names, hacktivists would get their hands on who they thought were identified as. This is something, for example the Charlottesville riots (many of them were doxxed), they didn't self-identify but rather showed up to a rally. People were fired from their jobs. Online hacktivism could be used for more than one ideological position, etc. They can produce good results, but they can also spread misinformation, reactionary, regressive and issues with harassment. (see next week). 

## This kind of brings us to the conclusion:

- Digital activism can take on forms ranging from political games to online protest movements. 
- Serious games can educate / persuade either directly or indirectly (ideology / analysis). 
- Anonymous is the best known group for online disrutption. 
- Effectiveness and ethics of the practices remain an open question.

Next Week: Gamergate; presentations.

## Group 3: Tiktok Security and Censorship
Research questions: What are some of the concerns with Tiktok regarding PRivacy, Censorship, and Security; 2: 

### About
Create, Share and Discover, express creativity. The app is 15-60 second videos, professional editing...

Common videos on Tiktok are lipsyncing, dancing, comedy, and challenges. 

Incited in 2014 (Musica.ly) -- was supposed to be an easy way for people to create music videos. In 2016, Muscially got 70 mil. downloads, and later got stolen by Us company Bytedance, called it 'TikTok'; aquired Musical.lym , then reached 1.5 billion useers. In the US, 26.5 milloon users (mostly young adults / teens). What makes it popular? Able to achieve the same amount of DAU's in 3 years that IG got in 6. TikTok uses an algorathm, friend made tiktok videos, then got a following of 2.5 millioon followers. Additionally, Old Town Road began to become popular after Lil Nas X. 

Tiktok has many celebrities on it, contributing to the mass popularity. Creaters have access to thousands of popular songs, and enables videos to be created easily. 

#### Revenue
Tiktok makes app currency that can be given between users to show support. Additionally, it is unclear where money comes from. ByteDance owns Tiktok, which uses similar algorithms to TikTok. They have a very strong partnership with the Communist Party of China. The persistant tiktok links to the Chinese government lead to the ban on military bases, etc. 

### Censorship
Tiktok's chinese roots affect users of the app. Stem from critisisms that it restricted videos in alignment with Chinese views of free speech. In 2019, TikTok used censorship techniques to prevent showing tiktok... Protests are censored in the US as well (according to Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg). 

Feroza's Aziz's TikTok account got suspended after posting a viral video about muslim detention camps in China. TikTok said that the US data is stored in the US with redundancy in Singapore. Senator Marco Rubio accused of censoring things that are not in chinese law...

Chuck Schumer and Tom Cotton allege that TikTok is forced to follow chinese law.

Content Moderation: Mostly chinese team. This fuelled concerns about censorship, etc. Alex Zhu was supposed to meet with congress but suspended the meeting after 'scheduling conflicts' Tiktok collects name, age, username, password, language, email, profile image, comments, content, payment info, social networking accounts, phone number, location, behaviour on social media, etc.

The T&C is a legally binding contract; they have a server in singapore and another in singapore. They use cookies to track interactions. Additionally, the T&C's is for private, non-commercial use. They update the T&C almost every month. They can delete account without your knowledge. They have overall control of your account, and can override account, disable or remove the account. You have 3 rights, however, right to access info, move data to your own server, or to have that data deleted.

The app knows location, metadata, cookies, etc. share information with 3rd party providers, buiness partner, advertisers and analytic providers. 

Share information with third party sources, etc. marketing firms... Ongoing investigation by tiktok's parent company (ByteDance): there is a notion that information is being stored and analyzed by the People's Republic of China. They think that foreign interference; ie. ban on Facebook, TikTok, etc. Takes precautionary steps to ensure that none of this data is left. 

Fuchs talks quite a bit about Jenkins' Participatory Culture, wherein TikTok is not really completely participatory. Addtionally, there have been several instances of censorship, etc. Users also do not have equal status, where popular creators receive sponsorships, etc. finally, they are a for profit company that commodifies data 'free labour' according to Fuchs. Fuchs also talks about Westin's Control Theory of Privacy, Etzioni: causes grave concern where Chinese companies are forced to share all of their data. This is a threat to national security, especially in military personnel.
